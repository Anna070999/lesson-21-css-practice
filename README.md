## ✨ What This Project Demonstrates

This lesson shows my ability to:

- Build clean, semantic HTML structure
- Create responsive layouts with flexbox
- Design pricing cards and CTA buttons
- Work with custom fonts and typography
- Add simple animations and scroll effects
- Organize files in a real front-end project (`assets/css`, assets/img, assets/fonts, `assets/js`)

This project is part of my ongoing learning and development as a Front-End Developer.
